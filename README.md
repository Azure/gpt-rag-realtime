# GPT-RAG Realtime

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

The **GPT-RAG Realtime** is an audio-enabled user interface that extends the GPT-RAG ecosystem with real-time voice interaction capabilities. It integrates with the GPT-RAG Orchestrator backend to enable natural, two-way communication, combining speech recognition, speech synthesis, and retrieval-augmented generation in a single experience.

## Prerequisites

Provision the infrastructure first by following the GPT-RAG repository instructions [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag/tree/feature/vnext-architecture). This ensures all required Azure resources (e.g., App Service, Storage, AI Search) are in place before deploying the web application.
